### About This Repo
**This is now the official repository for LCDSmartie main program.** <br />
All input on LCDSmartie is welcome.

After working with limbo for the last few months we've made many improvements to LCDSmartie, given it a slight re-design and is now ready for release. There are too many new features to even know where to start listing them.
Some changes of note:
* Resizable setup form
* New plugin management tab
* Re-designed actions tab
* Custom character management <p>
A more detailed list of changes can be found on [version changes](Documents/VersionChanges.md) document.
